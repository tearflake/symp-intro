# Symp Framework

**Symbolic Computing Pipeline ‚Äî form, meaning, and execution**

---

## üß© Overview

Symp unites three symbolic subsystems into a single programmable pipeline:

```

input ‚Üí syntax ‚Üí semantics ‚Üí execution ‚Üí output

````

Each stage is explicit, modular, and represented by its own symbolic language:

| Stage | Module | Role |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Syntax** | [Symbolmatch](symbolmatch.md) | Validates and parses form |
| **Semantics** | [Symbolverse](symbolverse.md) | Defines how meaning transforms structure |
| **Execution** | [Symbolprose](symbolprose.md) | Executes the resulting program |

Together, they make up the Symp framework ‚Äî a computing substrate for defining and composing **frames**.

## üß† What is a Frame?

A **frame** is the fundamental computing unit in Symp.  
It combines *form* and *meaning* into one executable definition:

```
(FRAME
  (SYNTAX   (APPLY symbolmatch  (SEXPR (RULES ...))))
  (SEMANTICS (APPLY symbolverse (SEXPR (REWRITE ...)))))
````

A frame becomes *alive* when applied to an input:

```
(APPLY myFrame (SEXPR myInput))
```

During execution:

1. The **syntax** part validates the input.
2. The **semantics** part transforms or executes it.
3. The **output** is returned as a constant `(SEXPR ‚Ä¶)`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Anatomy of the Pipeline

| Step | Module          | Description                                                |
| ---- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£  | **Symbolmatch** | Ensures the input follows the expected grammar.            |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£  | **Symbolverse** | Transforms the symbolic structure into an executable form. |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£  | **Symbolprose** | Interprets the graph and produces a symbolic result.       |

All stages use the same syntax ‚Äî symbolic S-expressions ‚Äî so they compose naturally.

## üßÆ Example: Equality Simplifier

A small end-to-end demonstration:

```
(APPLY
  (FRAME
    (SYNTAX
      (APPLY symbolmatch
        (SEXPR
          (RULES
            (FLAT <start> ATOMIC)))))

    (SEMANTICS
      (APPLY symbolverse
        (SEXPR
          (REWRITE
            (RULE
              (READ ("mul" x x))
              (WRITE ("pow" x "2"))))))))
  (SEXPR (eq (mul x x) (pow x 2))))
```

üß© **Step-by-step:**

1. `Symbolmatch` checks that the top-level input is a valid S-expression.
2. `Symbolverse` rewrites `(mul x x)` into `(pow x 2)`.
3. Result ‚Üí `(SEXPR (eq (pow x 2) (pow x 2)))`.

## üåÄ Nested and Custom Frames

Frames can reference other frames, or even *generate* new frames.
For example, a higher-order ‚Äúbuilder‚Äù frame may output a new `(FRAME ‚Ä¶)` definition.
This allows **metaprogramming** within a consistent symbolic model ‚Äî
without uncontrolled self-reference.

---

## üîç Why Use Symp?

* **Explicit computation pipeline** ‚Äî each stage visible and replaceable.
* **Composable DSLs** ‚Äî build language fragments by defining new frames.
* **Small core** ‚Äî few primitives, infinite combinations.
* **Self-describing** ‚Äî the system can express its own syntax and semantics.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Using Symp as a Backend

Symp can run as:

* A **CLI tool** evaluating symbolic frames.
* A **web service** over AJAX or WebSockets.
* A **library** embedded in other symbolic systems.

You can define your own frames, store them as files, and apply them dynamically.

## üîÆ Philosophy

> In Symp, computation is a conversation between *form* and *meaning*.
>
> Syntax defines what is allowed.
> Semantics decides what it means.
> Execution is simply the dialogue between them.
