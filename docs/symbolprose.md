# Symbolprose

**The executable graph of symbolic computation**

---

## üß© Purpose

`Symbolprose` defines the *runtime behavior* of Symp frames.  
Where `Symbolmatch` validates structure and `Symbolverse` rewrites meaning,  
`Symbolprose` executes the final computation through **directed symbolic graphs**.

## üìò Grammar Overview

```
(GRAPH
  (EDGE
    (SOURCE BEGIN)
    (INSTR
      (ASGN RESULT (mul 2 3)))
    (TARGET END)))
````

| Element     | Description                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **GRAPH**   | Container for execution flow.                |
| **EDGE**    | Directed link between two nodes.             |
| **INSTR**   | Instructions such as `ASGN` or `TEST`.       |
| **COMPUTE** | Encapsulate subgraphs for modular execution. |

## üí° Example

A simple multiplication program:

```
(APPLY
  symbolprose
  (SEXPR
    (GRAPH
      (EDGE
        (SOURCE BEGIN)
        (INSTR
          (ASGN RESULT (mul 6 7)))
        (TARGET END)))))
```

Output:

```
(SEXPR 42)
```

## üîç Notes

* The graph model allows conditional and sequential computation.
* Each `ASGN` assigns symbolic values; `TEST` enables flow control.
* `Symbolprose` is a symbolic virtual machine ‚Äî programs are data.
