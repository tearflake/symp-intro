## Symp

**a framework from a parallel reality where symbols won**

---

#### 🔮 Philosophy

What if programming had evolved around **form**, **meaning**, **execution**, and **intent** rather than machinery?

Syntax defines a form of expressions.  
Semantics decides what they mean.  
Runtime carries their execution.  
Presentation completes their intent.  

Symp is a small, strange, and honest framework evolved from form, meaning, execution, and intent.  
It carries a *thought experiment* from a reality in which symbols triumphed over flashing lights.

#### 💡 The Idea

In Symp, every computation follows one simple ritual:

```

syntax → semantics → runtime → presentation

````

Instead of hiding these stages,  
Symp makes each one **programmable**.

You don’t just write programs in Symp —  
you define *how* programs themselves should be understood.

#### 🧠 Why Symp Exists

Symp isn’t a Lisp dialect or a new syntax flavor.  
It’s a **computational philosophy**:

* Programs can prove their *form* before they express their *meaning*.
* *Meaning* of programs directs a way of their *execution*.
* Program *execution* reflects their *intent*.
* Everything can be described in its own **syntax**, **semantics**, **runtime**, and **presentation**.

It’s deliberately colorless, minimalist, and transparent.  
A tool for anyone who loves **building languages more than writing in them**.

#### 🚀 What You Can Build

Symp is tiny, but composable.  
It’s a playground for symbolic systems:

* Custom DSLs and interpreters
* Meta-compilers and term rewriters
* Theorem provers, logic engines, or exotic REPLs

Anything that can be described as “form → meaning → execution → intent”.

---

#### 🖤 Inspiration

Symp is inspired by symbolic expressions, parsing grammar rules, term rewriting systems, finite state machines, and HTML.
