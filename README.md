## 1. Introduction

**A symbolic processing framework**

---

### ðŸ’¡ motivation

Symp began as an exploration of what programming might look like if compilers were transparent conversations instead of black boxes.

---

### ðŸ§© What Is Symp?

Symp is a **minimalist symbolic computation backend**. It unifies parsing, transformation, and execution into one explicit pipeline:

```

input â†’ syntax â†’ semantics â†’ output

````

Instead of hiding these layers inside a compiler, Symp makes each stage programmable. Symp lets you experiment with how programming languages themselves think â€” right from the grammar to execution. You donâ€™t define *functions*. You define **frames** â€” each with its own *syntax* (form) and *semantics* (meaning).

---

### ðŸ§  Core Components

* **Symbolmatch**: PEG-like grammar engine â€” built-in syntax validation
* **Symbolverse**: term rewriting and transformation engine â€” built-in semantic processing
* **Symbolprose**: graph-based execution of symbolic programs â€” built-in semantic processing

These three systems for syntax analysis and semantic synthesis are connected through the **Symp glue language**, where you can write:

```
(APPLY
  (FRAME
    (SYNTAX (APPLY symbolmatch (SEXPR (RULES ...))))
    (SEMANTICS (APPLY symbolverse (SEXPR (REWRITE ...)))))
  (SEXPR myProgram))
```

---

### ðŸ”® Why Itâ€™s Different

* **Explicit meaning** â€“ You can *see* how syntax maps to semantics.
* **Composable** â€“ Each frame can use others as sub-frames.
* **Reflective** â€“ Frames can define new frames (meta-programming built in).
* **Minimal** â€“ Entire core fits in a few hundred lines.
* **Beautifully weird** â€“ A computing system from an alternate reality where theory outran graphics.

---

### ðŸ§¬ Design Philosophy

Every computation in Symp passes through **form** and **meaning**.

Syntax validates structure.  
Semantics transforms intent.  
Output becomes new input.  

Itâ€™s not a conventional programming language â€” itâ€™s a framework for building *languages of meaning*. Use it to prototype symbolic languages, theorem provers, or DSLs.

### ðŸ–¤ Inspiration

Symp is inspired by Lisp, PEGs, term rewriting systems, and finite state machines.
