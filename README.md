## Symp

**a framework from a parallel reality where symbols won**

---

#### 🔮 Philosophy

What if there is a world where programming has evolved around source code ergonomics rather than user interface machinery?

* In that world, computer displays never evolved beyond the monochrome text mode.
* Instead, the programming theory advanced far beyond the one from this world.
* Source code became a subject of seeking beauty in structures of its appearance.

Symp is a small, strange, and honest framework evolved from using restricted visuals in a favor of rich programming theory.
It carries a *thought experiment* from a reality in which symbols triumphed over flashing lights.

#### 💡 The Idea

In Symp, every interaction may follow a simple cyclic ritual:

```
      • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •
      •                                 •
• • ► •   u s e r   i n t e r f a c e   • • • •
•     •                                 •     •
•     • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •     •
•                                             •
•                                             •
•         • • • • • • • • • • • • • •         •
•         •                         •         •
•         •     r e w r i t e r     •         •
• • • • • •   f u n c t i o n a l   • ◄ • • • •
          •     a s s e m b l y     •
          •                         •
          • • • • • • • • • • • • • •
```

While the modest frontend user interface is baked in, the programming backend spans free over a wide range between low level and high level programming.

The backend set of programming paradigms should provide an easy way to define new domain specific frameworks using the right tools for the right tasks.

It is possible to choose between rudimentary but fast assembly programming, middle ground functional programming, and advanced but slow term rewriter programming.

Each of the initially supplied paradigms favor minimalist design, differing not in complexity, yet only in their approach to solve various kinds of programming tasks.

#### 🧠 Why Symp Exists

Symp is an S-expression based programming meta-framework.  
It’s deliberately colorless, minimalist, and transparent.  
A tool for anyone who loves building languages more than writing in them.  

---

#### 🚀 What You Can Build

Symp is tiny, but composable.  
It’s a playground for symbolic systems:

* Domain specific interpreters
* Meta-compilers and term rewriters
* Theorem provers, logic engines, or exotic REPLs

Anything that can be described as a programming paradigm.

---

#### 🖤 Inspiration

Symp is inspired by symbolic expressions, term rewriting, lambda calculus, assembly frameworks, and HTML forms user interface.
