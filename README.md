## Symp

a programming framework from a parallel reality where symbols won

---

#### Philosophy

What if there is a world where programming has evolved around source code ergonomics rather than user interface machinery?

* In that world, computer displays never evolved beyond the monochrome text mode.
* Instead, the programming theory advanced far beyond the one from this world.
* Source code became a subject of seeking beauty in structures of its appearance.

Symp is a small, strange, and honest framework evolved from using restricted visuals in a favor of rich programming theory.
It carries a thought experiment from a reality in which symbols triumphed over flashing lights.

#### The Idea

In Symp, every interaction may follow a simple cyclic ritual:

```
      · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·
      ·                                 ·
· · > ·        p a g e f r o n t        · · · ·
·     ·                                 ·     ·
·     · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·     ·
·                                             ·
·                                             ·
·         · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·         ·
·         ·                         ·         ·
·         ·     r e w r i t e r     ·         ·
· · · · · ·   f u n c t i o n a l   · < · · · ·
          ·     a s s e m b l y     ·
          ·                         ·
          · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

While the modest frontend user interface is baked in (pagefront), the programming backend spans free over the whole range between low level and high level programming.

It is possible to choose between rudimentary but fast assembly execution, middle ground functional programming, and advanced but slow term rewriting.

The backend set of programming paradigms should provide an easy way to define new domain specific frameworks using the right tools for the right tasks.

#### Why Symp Exists

Symp is an S-expression based programming framework.\
It’s colorless and minimalist although computationally complete.\
A tool for building programming frameworks as well as writing in them.

---

#### What You Can Build

Symp is tiny, but composable.\
It’s a playground for symbolic systems:

* Domain specific interpreters
* Meta-compilers and term rewriters
* Theorem provers and logic engines

Anything computable using strict rules.

---

#### Inspiration

Symp is inspired by symbolic expressions, assembly approach, lambda calculus, term rewriting, and HTML forms user interface.
